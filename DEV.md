# Developing `licence_audit`

This document is for contributors. End-user docs live in [README.md](./README.md).

## Toolchain

This repository uses [mise](https://mise.jdx.dev/) to pin Gleam and Erlang
versions. Trust the local tool configuration once:

```sh
mise trust
```

You normally do not need to run `mise exec --` directly — every `just`
recipe wraps its commands in `mise exec --` already, so `just build`,
`just test`, etc. pick up the pinned toolchain automatically. Only fall
back to `mise exec -- <command>` when running tools that don't have a
`just` recipe.

## Build from source

```sh
just build
```

`just build` compiles the Gleam project and produces the escript at
`./licence_audit`.

## Common tasks

```sh
just test           # gleam test
just check          # gleam check (type check only)
just format         # gleam format src test
just format-check   # gleam format --check src test
just glint          # gleam run -m glinter (linter; fails only on error-level rules)
just lint           # format-check + glint
just ci             # full validation (format-check + glint + check + test + strict build)
just clean          # remove build artifacts
```

Run `just` with no arguments to see the full recipe list.

To run a single Gleam test module, invoke `gleam test` directly through
mise and pass the module name:

```sh
mise exec -- gleam test --target erlang -- <module_name>_test
```

## Update subcommand

The shipped CLI exposes `licence_audit update`. It interactively reviews
discovered licences and writes the selected `[tools.licence_audit]` policy
using the `tomlet` Git dependency; no native helper binary is required.

## Library entry points

`run_with` and `run_with_progress` in `src/licence_audit.gleam` append
`--no-cache` so library and test runs never touch the on-disk DETS cache.
Only the CLI path uses the cache.

## SBOM reproducibility (`sbom --reproducible`)

The `sbom` subcommand emits a fresh random `serialNumber` and a
wall-clock `metadata.timestamp` by default, and switches to a
content-derived `urn:uuid` (SHA-256 of the BOM payload, formatted as an
RFC 9562 v8 UUID) plus a `SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH`-driven timestamp under
`--reproducible`. Components and `dependsOn` lists are sorted
deterministically in both modes — that ordering is a prerequisite for
the content-derived serial and also keeps regular diffs of committed
SBOMs useful.

The flag exists rather than being always-on for these reasons:

- **CycloneDX semantics.** The spec defines `serialNumber` as a unique
  identifier for *this BOM document instance* and `metadata.timestamp`
  as the actual creation time. Always-reproducible output collapses
  multiple generations of the same dependency set onto one serial and
  reports a fake timestamp, which can break downstream consumers
  (Dependency-Track, vuln scanners, in-toto/SLSA attestations) that
  treat the serial as per-build identity.
- **Most uses want per-build identity.** Uploading to an SBOM registry,
  attaching to a release, or feeding a scanner benefits from a fresh
  UUID and real timestamp; reproducibility primarily helps the
  commit-and-diff workflow.
- **Convention.** Reproducible-builds tooling is conventionally
  opt-in (flag or `SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH`) precisely because it trades away
  useful metadata.
- **Reversibility.** Going always-reproducible later would require a
  new flag like `--with-timestamp` to recover today's defaults, which
  is uglier than the current `--reproducible` opt-in.

Library callers select the mode via the `SerialNumber` variant on
`SbomInput` (`FixedSerial(String)` for the default random-v4 path and
`ContentDerivedSerial` for the reproducible path).

The release workflow (`.github/workflows/publish.yml`) intentionally
does **not** pass `--reproducible`. A release SBOM is a one-shot
artifact attached to a specific tag and signed by `actions/attest`, so it
should carry a unique `serialNumber` and a real `metadata.timestamp` —
that is what downstream SBOM registries and vuln scanners expect, and the
Sigstore attestation already provides a verifiable creation time.
Reproducibility is for the "commit the SBOM and diff it in CI" workflow,
not for signed per-release artifacts.

## Changelog

Changelog fragments are managed with
[changie](https://github.com/miniscruff/changie):

```sh
just change             # create a new changelog fragment
just changelog-preview  # preview the unreleased section
just changelog          # merge unreleased fragments into CHANGELOG.md
```

Releases are produced by the `release.yml` and `publish.yml` GitHub Actions
workflows; do not edit `CHANGELOG.md` or bump the version in `gleam.toml` by
hand.

For now, releases are escript-only GitHub release packages. The project is not
set up to publish the Gleam package to Hex.
